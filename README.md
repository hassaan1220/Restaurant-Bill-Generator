# Restaurant-Bill-Generator
This is a full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express, and EJS that generates printable restaurant-style bills dynamically.

.Bootstrap (for basic styling)
.Middleware for data handling

What I Learned:
.How to build server-side applications using Express
.Passing data between views using middleware
.Rendering dynamic pages using EJS
.Structuring a multi-page web app with logical data flow
